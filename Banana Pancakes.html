    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Fluffy banana pancakes made from scratch with mashed ripe bananas that are ready in minutes for a delicious twist on ordinary pancakes.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>sugar</li>
        <li>baking powder</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>an egg</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>vegtable oil</li>
        <li>bananas</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix
            Combine your dry ingredients (flour, sugar, salt, baking powder) in one bowl and your wet ingredients (egg, milk, vegetable oil, mashed bananas) in another bowl. Add the dry ingredients to the bowl with the wet ingredients, then stir until they're incorporated. It's OK if your batter is slightly lumpy.</li>
        Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Sauté carrots, zucchini, and garlic in hot butter until
            tender. Stir in heavy cream, Parmesan cheese, and dill. Cook and stir until thickened. Add cooked spaghetti
            and mix until evenly coated.</li>
            <li>Cook
                Pour the batter in ¼ cup portions onto a lightly oiled pan or griddle over medium-high heat. Cook for a few minutes, flip with a spatula, and cook for another few minutes (or until each side is golden brown).
            </li>
            <li>Serve
                Serve your banana pancakes immediately. They're delicious alone or with your favorite pancake toppings.</li>
